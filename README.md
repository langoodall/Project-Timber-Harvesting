# Project-Timber-Harvesting
A project focused on predicting near-future timber harvest volumes and prices using data from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS).

Currently, I'm converting historical "Cut and Sold" reports for USFS Region 6 (Pacific Northwest national forests) from PDF to structured tabular formats, as no public Excel versions exist. Once the data is cleaned and formatted, I plan to conduct time series analyses to forecast future timber harvesting trends for income and volume harvested.
